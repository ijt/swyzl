<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>A problem that frequently occurs when writing unit tests is how to test
a unit in isolation from other classes.</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to create Mock Objects that mimic
interface of the classes that the unit depends on. The Mock Object can
then return canned values in response to method calls, or check that
the expected methods are called with the correct arguments. Mock
Objects are described in detail in the paper by Tim Mackinnon and Steve
Freeman that can be found on the MockObjects website: <a class="reference" href="http://www.mockobjects.com">http://www.mockobjects.com</a></p>
<p>One problem with Mock objects is that they can be tedious to create. In
a statically typed language every method in the interface must be
stubbed out, even if it is never called, or if the test is not
interested in the call. Fortunately with a dynamically typed language
such as Python there is an alternative way of creating Mock Objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-python-mock-class">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2" name="the-python-mock-class">The Python Mock Class</a></h1>
<p>The idea behind the Python Mock class is simple. It can mimic any other
Python class, and then be examined to see what methods have been called
and what the parameters to the call were. The constructor for the Mock
class takes an optional dictionary specifying method names and
values to return when that method is called. Methods that are not
specified in the constructor return None.</p>
<p>Method calls on a Mock Object are caught by the __getattr__ method and
stored for later inspection. The __getattr__ method returns an
intermediate object (MockCaller) that does all the work, so it is
possible to treat it as a bound method.</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import Mock 
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock = Mock( {&quot;foo&quot; : &quot;you called foo&quot;} ) 
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock.foo() 
'you called foo' 
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = myMock.foo 
&gt;&gt;&gt; f 
&lt;mock.MockCaller instance at 15d46d0&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; f() 'you called foo' 
&gt;&gt;&gt; f( &quot;wibble&quot; ) 
'you called foo' 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>It is possible to specify that successive calls to a method returns a
sequence of values by using the ReturnValues or ReturnIterator objects.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to access attributes of the Mock class that are
not methods. The simplest way is to create the Mock object first then
assign the attributes required before they are needed. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import Mock 
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock = Mock() 
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock.greeting = &quot;hello world&quot; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print myMock.greeting 
hello world 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>Alternatively if the mock object is to be created in several places it
may be preferable to create a subclass of Mock that initialises the
attributes in the constructor.</p>
<p>As well as making the history of method calls available for inspection, the
Mock class also allows you to set up expectations, which are assertions made
at the time that a method is called.  See below for more details on
expectations.</p>
<p>One other issue to be aware of is that __getattr__ takes precedence
over the the normal builtin methods that classes have by default, such
as __repr__, __str__, __hash__ etc. For example,</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print myMock
</pre>
<p>will fail since __repr__ will return None instead of a string.</p>
<p>If the code you are testing makes use of these methods then you will
need to derive a class from Mock that supplies the correct behaviour
(see below for more on extending Mock).</p>
<div class="section" id="example-usage">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" name="example-usage">Example Usage</a></h2>
<p>Here is an example of how to use it in action. Assume you are testing
an application that communicates with a database using the Python DB2.0
API. You want to write a test for a function called 'persistData', but
without having to create a database connection, populate the database
with test data, etc. The persistData function takes two parameters - an
object with the data to persist, and a database connection object. You
can write the test like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class PersistanceTestCase(unittest.TestCase): 
    def testPersistData(self): 
        #set up the mock objects 
        mockCursor = Mock()
        mockDB = Mock( { &quot;cursor&quot; : mockCursor } ) 
        #call the function to be tested
        persistData(testData, mockDB) 
        #test the correct calls were made on the database 
        objects mockDB.mockCheckCall(0, 'cursor')
        mockCursor.mockCheckCall(0, 
                                 'execute', 
                                 '...some SQL...',
                                  someData) 
        mockCursor.mockCheckCall(1, 
                                 'execute', 
                                 '...more SQL...', 
                                  moreData) 
        mockDB.mockCheckCall(1, 'commit')
        mockDB.mockCheckCall(2, 'close')
</pre>
<p>The test creates two mock objects, one for the database, and one for
the cursor object that is returned when the cursor() method is called
on the database.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" name="retrieving-information-about-method-calls">Retrieving information about method calls</a></h1>
<p>The Mock class has the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">__init__(self, **methodReturnValues):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initialises the mock object. It takes keyword parameters that specifies return
values for mocked methods. Methods that are not specified in the constructor
will return None.</p>
<p>The return values can be assigned either a single object, which will be
returned on every call, or to an instance of the ReturnValues(*values) or
ReturnIterator(iterator) classes.</p>
<p>These are created with a series of values or an iterator that returns
a series of values respectively, and each call to the method will return the
next element in the sequence. If there are more calls made than there are
elements in the sequence then an AssertionError will be raised.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; mock = Mock( { &quot;getSquares&quot;:ReturnValues(1,4,9) } )
&gt;&gt;&gt; mock.getSquares()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; mock.getSquares()
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; mock.getSquares()

</li>
<li><p class="first">mockAddReturnValues(self, **methodReturnValues ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add more return values to a mock object.  See the notes for __init__.
If a return value is specified for an existing method name, then the previous
return value is replaced with the new one.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">mockGetAllCalls():</p>

<p>Takes the name of a method and returns a list of MockCall objects representing
the calls to that method, in the order they were made.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">mockCheckCall(self, tester, index, name, *args, **kwargs)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test that the index-th call to the mock object has the specified method name

    def test_single_call( self ):
        mock = Mock()
        mock.testMethod( &quot;hello&quot;, key=&quot;some value&quot; )

<blockquote>
<p>Sets an expectation on the method called 'name'.  Every time the method is
called the testFn is called to check that the expectation is correct.  The
method takes the following parameters:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mockObject:  the Mock object that the method is on
callObject:  the MockCall object representing the current call
count:       the total number of calls that have previously been made on the
             mockObject. i.e. the first method called will have a count of
             0.
</pre>
<p>The testFn should return True if the expectation succeeds, and false if it
does not.  If an expectation fails then the mock object will raise an
exception.</p>
<p>You can specify that the expectation only applies to a range of calls using the optional
'after' and 'until' parameters.  For example:  mockSetExpectation(... after=2, until=5)
will create an expectation that will start after 2 calls have been made to the method, and stop on the
5th call, so will only be called on the 3rd and 4th calls to the method.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several expectations can be set up on the same method, and they will be tested
in turn.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" name="extending-the-mock-class">Extending the Mock class</a></h1>
<p>There are times when the default behaviour of the Mock class is not sufficient
for the tests you want to perform. Perhaps you need a method that does more
than return the same value every time, or you want to make assertions about
the call at the point that it is made rather than afterwards, or you want to
raise an exception from within a method to test your unit's error handling. To
do all these simply derive a new class from Mock and add the methods with the
specialised behaviour. All the other methods will still be handled by the Mock
class.</p>
<p>There is one issue to watch out for. If you want the call to your specialised
method to be recorded along with all the other methods then you must pass the
method call up to the base class. However you cannot do this in the normal way
because of the way that the call is intercepted by __getattr__. Instead the
method must call __getattr__ directly to get a MockCaller object, then call
the MockCaller to pass it the parameters.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MockSub( Mock ):
     def getSquare( self, x ):
         '''return the square of the parameter passed'''
         #call base class method so that it gets recorded
         Mock.__getattr__(self, 'getSquare')( x )
         return x*x
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interface-checking">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" name="interface-checking">Interface Checking</a></h1>
<p>One problem with using Mocks in Python is that the unit tests can get out of
sync with the production code. An interface method that is called through a
mock object in a unit test may later be renamed in production code, but the
mock and some production code that called it may be left using the old name.</p>
<p>To protect against such problems, you can optionally pass in a class that is
being mocked to the Mock constructor. As each call is made to the Mock object,
it will check that a method with that name also exists on the real class, and
the call parameters match the argument list of the original method.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MyOriginalClass:
    def writeUserToDb(self, user):
        '''Write the user to the database.'''
        longRunningFunction(user)
        #...

&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import Mock
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock = Mock({&quot;writeUserToDb&quot; : False}, MyOriginalClass)
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock.unknownFunc()
[snip traceback]
mock.MockInterfaceError: Calling mock method 'unknownFunc' that was not found in the original class
&gt;&gt;&gt; myMock.writeUserToDb(None, 1)
[snip traceback]
mock.MockInterfaceError: Original writeUserToDb() takes 2 arguments (3 given)
</pre>
<p>Methods with varargs, keyword parameters and/or defaults are also supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-inheritance">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" name="multiple-inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes you don't want to mock all the methods of a class; the real methods
in the original class may be fine for many methods. For instance, a class that
implements a template method pattern is designed to be subclassed. Template
methods must each be implemented by all subclasses.</p>
<p>You may want to assert how template methods are called based upon calls to the
base class interface methods. In cases like this, you can multiply inherit
from both the production class and from the Mock class. By subclassing from
both, you get the default behaviours of the original methods, and method call
recording from the Mock class.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class TemplateMethodBase:
    def func(self, x):
        '''Calls template method &quot;overflow&quot; if x is too big.'''
        if x &gt; 10000000:
            self.overflow(x)
        return x*x
    def overflow(self, x):
        raise NotImplementedError

class TemplateMethodMock(TemplateMethodBase, Mock):
    def overflow(self, x):
        print &quot;%d might be a little too big&quot; % x

&gt;&gt;&gt; m = TemplateMethodMock()
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.func(20000000)
20000000 may be a little too big
400000000000000L
&gt;&gt;&gt; print m.mockGetAllCalls()[0]
func(20000000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print m.mockGetAllCalls()[1]
overflow(20000000)
</pre>
<p>This feature can be used in conjunction with expectations, for example to cause
a method call on a non-mock object to raise an exception.</p>
