    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Julia was puzzled by many things, but not by puzzles. She would arrange the letters in her mind as 
  	she lay in bed, then spoke them to her computer once she arose. None of the puzzles here were 
  	machine generated. They are the thoughtful result of an active mind, keen on her task to the very end. </p>

    <p>We hope that you enjoy solving them as much as she enjoyed writing them. Choose from the books above to get started.</p>
