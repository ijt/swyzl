  That's going to use http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html#notification_api
  
- Add ?tab=make url parameter so we can have the Login to Make take us to the right spot. 

- Add statistics: what percent of people solved this puzzle? What's the shortest time?

- Keep info on what puzzle the user was playing and which letters were entered,
  and any info on a partially entered puzzle.
