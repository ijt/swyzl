- When you solve a puzzle it should take you to the next one.

- Have the initial page be a hall of fame showing who solved the most puzzles and who is the fastest.

- Order the puzzles numerically in the nav column.

- Possibly do something other than having a puzzle of the day.

- Figure out how to get gcheckout to notify the swyzl back-end of the purchases that have been made.
  That's going to use http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html#notification_api
  
- Add ?tab=make url parameter so we can have the Login to Make take us to the right spot. 

- Add statistics: what percent of people solved this puzzle? What's the shortest time?

- Keep info on what puzzle the user was playing and which letters were entered,
  and any info on a partially entered puzzle.

- Charge for an iPhone SDK version

- Show a picture when someone successfully completes the puzzle

The ajax call should return an obj { html:"...", encodingMap: {} }.

BUG: Login links don't work on IE.
