- Write script to clear db and populate it with puzzles.
- Write puzzle pack-based UI.

- Figure out how to get gcheckout to notify the swyzl back-end of the purchases that have been made.
  That's going to use http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html#notification_api
  
- Add ?tab=make url parameter so we can have the Login to Make take us to the right spot. 

- Keep info on what puzzle the user was playing and which letters were entered,
  and any info on a partially entered puzzle.

- Charge for an iPhone SDK version

The ajax call should return an obj { html:"...", encodingMap: {} }.

BUG: Login links don't work on IE.
